<button (click)="logOut()" class="custom-button" *ngIf="router.url !== '/login' && router.url !== '/registration'">Log out</button>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>

<!-- The router-outlet directive acts as a placeholder that Angular dynamically fills based on the current router state. 
     When the user navigates to a particular route, Angular loads the corresponding component into this outlet. -->
